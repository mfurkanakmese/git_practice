In this section we'll be creating a small Object Oriented Application. The various exercises will build on each other.

Let's model a blackjack game! The game we'll be creating will be very simple. It will be "first to 21".
It will not ask for bets. The user and the computer will each start with a small pot and bets will be taken automatically.

1) Create four classes:
    BlackjackController.java (this will contain the main())
    Player.java (POJO - this will contain player info)
    Card.java (POJO - this will hold card data)
    Deck.java (POJO - this will hold deck data)
    Hand.java (POJO - this will hold Hand data)


2) Fill out each POJO above to the best of your ability. Also create a main() method in the BlackJackController class.

3) Create appropriate constructors for each of the POJO's above.
